      <article><b><u>ARDUINO</u></b><br>
      <p>  Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control both physically and digitally. Its products are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL),[1] permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form or as do-it-yourself (DIY) kits.</p>

<p>Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards or breadboards (shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers are typically programmed using a dialect of features from the programming languages C and C++. In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Processing language project.</p>

      <article><b><u>MOTOR DRIVER(L293D)</u></b>
        <p>The L293D is a 16-pin Motor Driver IC which can control a set of two DC motors simultaneously in any direction. The L293D is designed to provide bidirectional drive currents of up to 600 mA (per channel) at voltages from 4.5 V to 36 V (at pin 8!). You can use it to control small dc motors - toy motors. Sometimes it can be extremely hot.

      <article><b><u>IR SENSOR</u></b><br><br>
        IR Sensor consists of two parts IR Transmitter and IR Receiver<br>

        <i><b><u>IR TRANSMITTER</u></b></i>
        <center><img src="C:\Users\adity\Desktop\bots\ir1.jpg" height="200" width="200" ><HR></img></center>
        <p>Infrared Transmitter is a light emitting diode (LED) which emits infrared radiations. Hence, they are called IR LEDâ€™s. Even though an IR LED looks like a normal LED, the radiation emitted by it is invisible to the human eye.</p><hr>
        <i><b><u>IR RECEIVER</u></b></i>
        <center><img src="C:\Users\adity\Desktop\bots\ir2.jpg" height="200" width="200" ><HR></img></center>
        <p>Infrared receivers are also called as infrared sensors as they detect the radiation from an IR transmitter. IR receivers come in the form of photodiodes and phototransistors. Infrared Photodiodes are different from normal photo diodes as they detect only infrared radiation. </p><hr>
